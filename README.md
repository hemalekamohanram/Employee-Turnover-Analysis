# Employee Turnover Analysis

## Project Purpose
This project analyzes employee turnover (attrition) to identify factors contributing to employees leaving an organization and builds predictive models to forecast which employees are at high risk of leaving. The goal is to provide actionable insights that HR teams can use to reduce turnover and improve employee retention.

## Features & Analyses
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualizations of employee demographics, job satisfaction, work hours, and other factors.  
   - Identification of patterns associated with attrition.  

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and data balancing (resampling).  

3. **Predictive Modeling:**  
   - Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.  
   - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.  
   - Comparison of model performance to select the best model.  

4. **Insights & Recommendations:**  
   - Identification of top features influencing turnover.  
   - Actionable strategies for HR to reduce attrition.
